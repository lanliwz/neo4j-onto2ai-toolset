		<rdfs:label>Functional Entities Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines the fundamental concepts for entities defined by their function, such as the relationship to the various forms which one or another functionally-defined entity may take. It also includes a number of basic types of entity defined by function, such as business and non-profit. The concepts in this ontology are intended to be extensible in other ontologies which may be dedicated to specific kinds of functionally-defined business entity or organization.</dcterms:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was augmented to include general definitions for syndicate and syndicate member (LOAN-169).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified by the FIBO 2.0 revision to address missing labels and definitions on the deprecated sole proprietorship class to match those in the equivalent class.</skos:changeNote>

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO BE 1.1 RTF report. Changes include deprecation of the SoleProprietorship class and making it equivalent to the class with the same name in the Sole Proprietorships ontology.

		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to revise and extend the definition of merchant, to support merchant category codes as needed for representation of credit card transactions, merge business and functional business entity and eliminate commerce and commercial activity (which are not used anywhere in FIBO), and to clean up definitions and make them ISO 704 compliant.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/BE/FunctionalEntities/FunctionalEntities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC) and to eliminate redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Merchant categories are organized by the type of business, trade or services supplied. Certain category codes including those for very large businesses, such as airlines and some hotel chains, may be delineated to the point of identifying the business. Merchant category codes and/or the descriptions of the service categories are frequently used in credit card and other banking transactions for analysis, transaction classification, such as for use in promotional rewards, and sometimes tax-related purposes.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Values are specified only for those merchant categories that are generally expected to originate retail financial transactions. Criteria for establishing a new category code includes (a) the merchant category is reasonable and substantially different from all other merchant categories currently represented in the list of code values; (b) the merchant category is separate and distinct from all other industries currently represented in the list of code values; (c) the proposal describes a merchant category or industry, and not a process; (d) the minimum annual sales volume of merchants included in the merchant category, taken as a whole, is USD 10 million; and (e) sufficient justification for the addition of a new code value is found.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
