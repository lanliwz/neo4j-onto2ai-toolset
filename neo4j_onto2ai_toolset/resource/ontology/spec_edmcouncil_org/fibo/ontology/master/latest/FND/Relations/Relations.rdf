		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20170201/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the FIBO 2.0 RFC to include additional properties and the linkage to LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Relations/Relations.owl version of the ontology submitted with the FIBO FND RFC, was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations
	(6) to move the ontology from the Utilities module to an independent Relations module
	(7) to revise a number of definitions, per discussion with various stakeholders.
	(8) to augment the definitions to include entity names from Business Entities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate deprecations that are more than 6 months old and to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate elements that have been deprecated for several quarters (FND-386).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/. It was further revised in FTF 2 resulting in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.2 RTF report.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to add Reference as a superclass of Name and use the hasTextValue property as the superproperty of certain data properties.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to clean up references to external dictionaries that don&apos;t meet FIBO policies, eliminate ambiguity where possible, eliminate the superproperties of produces and is produced by, whose semantics are different from their parent properties, and improve ISO 704 compliance of definitions.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication with concepts in LCC and remove the unused hasDispositionDate property, whose semantics were unclear at best.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to incorporate evaluates and isEvaluatedBy, and to loosen constraints on hasName properties to allow multi-lingual names.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to loosen constraints on properties using xsd:dateTime in their range to allow for more flexible representation, and to add properties including produces, isProducedBy.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to move hasAcquisitionDate to Financial Dates to improve usability and simplify reasoning, to eliminate circular definitions, to deprecate fibo-fnd-rel-rel;hasTag in favor of the simpler LCC property of the same name, to loosen domain restrictions on some properties which were too narrowly specified, and to add two new properties, describes and isDescribedBy, which are more appropriate for certain cases where we were using characterizes and isCharacterizedBy.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to move the property &apos;exchanges&apos; to FND given that it could be applied more generally than with respect to swaps only.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to move the property, &apos;is conferred on&apos; to the Legal Capacity ontology and to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Relations/Relations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to remove the deprecated hasTag property.</skos:changeNote>
