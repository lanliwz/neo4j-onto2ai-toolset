		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified for the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate it with LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20180801/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate deprecated elements.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20190901/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate circular and ambiguous definitions, and simplify the ontology by merging physical site with site.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20210101/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to allow a facility to exist at some location that has an address without requiring it to be situated at some site to simplify usage in cases where the site and facility have 100 percent overlap and are not tracked independently.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20220101/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20220701/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to allow a facility to be anything rather than a role.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Facilities.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Facilities.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to integrate with the new real property ontology (LOAN-168).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.</skos:changeNote>
