		<rdfs:label>Agreements Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dcterms:abstract>This ontology defines the concept of an agreement and roles that parties to an agreement play in the context of financial agreements. Agreements represent an understanding between parties, whereas contracts typically formalize such agreements.</dcterms:abstract>

		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Agreements/Agreements.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
   (1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
   (2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
   (3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
   (4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
   (5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.
   (6) to revise a few of the definitions based on more formal sources.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified per FIBO 2.0 RFC to add general concepts including obligor, obligee, and beneficiary in support of other FIBO domain areas.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.0 FTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.0/AboutFND-1.0/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified per the issue resolutions identified in the FIBO FND 1.1 RTF report and in https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/1.1/AboutFND-1.1/.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified to add bilateral and multilateral agreement definitions (DER-55), and to eliminate certain constructs that are redundant and will never be materialized to reduce the number of nodes required for various contract-related searches, such as &apos;mutual agreement&apos; (FND-391).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Agreements/Agreement.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary, clean up definitions to conform with ISO 704, add a missing restriction to mutual commitment, and eliminate an unnecessary reference to LCC.</skos:changeNote>
