# RDF Ontology to Neo4j Converter

This repository is created to manage, convert, and tag RDF ontology in Neo4j. It is used to load RDF ontology into Neo4j and convert it into an easy-to-understand Neo4j concept. In this conversion:

- Classes become nodes
- Object properties become edges
- Annotations become class node data properties

This allows for a more intuitive understanding and manipulation of RDF ontology within the Neo4j environment.
